Instruction on how to build the Lucene index 

1. We have converted the .ipynb Jupyter Notebooks to index and search.py files. 
  The file index.py should be first converted into an executable file.
  Run the below command to do so:-

     python3 index.py 

 Please ignore all the print statements after running the above command.It should create an lucene index directory called  ‘LuceneIndexAutocomplete1’
 We have converted the .ipynb Jupyter Notebook to a .py file. 

2.To run the search file first convert the search.py to an executable file,
 
     chmod +x search.py

  After the executable is created, run the following commands to see various outputs in the below snippets. 

     python3 search.py 'locality:Austin'  
     
     python3 search.py 'locality:Austin,name:Starbucks'
   
     python3 search.py 'locality:Austin,name:Starbucks,rating:2'

     python3 search.py 'locality:Austin,name:Starbucks,rating:2,price:$$'
